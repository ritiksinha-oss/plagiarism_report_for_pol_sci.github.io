requirement of Internal Evaluation for Political Science – III Submitted By Ritik Kumar Sinha B;2020 146 Under the guidance of Prof.Shriya MoktaChapterisation Introduction India is one ofthe major and relevant countries in the world.This is highlighted by the fact that it is the world ’ s seventh-largest country in terms of area1，fifth-largest in terms of economy2，and very importantly，second largest in terms of population3.This research paper aims to find out whether or not India is a deservingcandidate for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council(hereafter referred to as UNSC)，incidentally looking at the contributions the country has made towards world peace and thereby finding out the impediments that the country would have to pass toachieve its goal.The UNSC has primary responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and security4.This research paper also aims to find outwhether the UNSC needs to become more inclusive of the world and not only invite the P5 countries to make major decisions.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="2">Challenges faced In this chapter，the researchers plead to look at what are the challenges faced by India which it would have to tackle in order to securea permanent seat for itself at the UNSC.The researchers will primarily look at the stonewalling of China to prevent India from securing a permanent seat.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="3">At the same time，the researchers would be failing in their duty ifthey do not look at the intrinsic problems of India，as the volatile state of the Indian economy，the poorperformance of India at human development indices，and the competition that it faces from other G4 nations.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="4">Given India ’ s contributions to the UNSC，the challenges that India faces must be underscored.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="5">One of the major challenges that New Delhi faces when making its bid to become one of the permanent member states at the UNSCis from China.China has time and again stonewalled India from becoming a member of the UNSC.Most recently，in February 2021，it talked about a ‘ package solution ’ for India ’ s prospects to become a permanent member.It suggested that the otherP5 members are not in support of making India a permanent member[1].It prevents India from becoming a permanent member by giving diplomatic statementsagain and again and using its veto power which is available to all the permanent members.All the other permanent members of the security council have comein full support of India becoming a permanent member except China.Beijing ’ s all-time ally Pakistan is also completely opposed to India becoming apermanent member.It does so foremostly to maintain its hegemony that it enjoys in the Asian region.If India becomes a permanent member，it can create problems for China by asking valid questions and using its veto power.However，presently，China’ s stonewalling India for a permanent seat at the UNSC is arguably the biggest challenge that India faces.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="6">There are intrinsic problems of India as well that create challenges for itself to become a permanent member.First and foremost，India lags behind all the P5 nations in terms of various indices including but not limited to hunger index，human development index，passport index，ease of doing business index，and other important indices.[2]What the low performance ofIndia in these various indicesdoes is weaken India ’ s credibility and competitiveness over becoming a permanent member.Most ofthe P5 nations perform very well in most ofthese important indices.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="7">It is a relatively less known fact that India was actually offered a permanent seat at the UNSC by both the superpowers of that time，USSR and the USA in 1955 and 1950 respectively[3]but India，under the leadership of Nehru denied it due to Cold War politics during that era.India hasalready lost an opportunity to become apermanent member.One other internal reason that may provide resistance to India ’ s permanent membership is that its military power beyond theIndian Ocean region is still to be tested.India is a big player in terms of its military capacity.However，most of its weapons，tanks，air missiles，helicopters，fighter jets and navy warships，etc.are heavily dependent on imports.This implies that during times of crisis，India may not be able to sustainably defend itself.This presents a challenge for India to become apermanent member of an organization that deals with the security issues around the world.Also，India has not developed many military bases outside the Indian Subcontinent and that is another roadblock.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="8">Yet another important criticism India faces is that it has still not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty[4]and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996.[5]The third major roadblock to India ’ s permanent membership comes from its competition withother countries.The present P5 nations do not support any major expansion of the Security Council.[6]This implies that there maynot be more than one or two permanent seats that may open in the foreseeable future.Since there are very limited seats available，the amount of competition is high.There is a bloc of 4 countries that push each other ’ scandidature for a permanent membership to the UNSC.The bloc is known as G4 and comprises India，Brazil，Germany and Japan.These countries compete and push each other at the same time.In 1990s，Japan had been engaged in a number of peacekeeping operations led by either the U.N.，U.N.A.，or OAS until they withdrew their troops from these missions in 2003.[7]The Japanese government isnow considering participating in new peacekeeping missions with a greater emphasis on counterterrorism and protecting women and children from sexual violence.Along with Japan，the other G4 nations including Germany[8]and Brazil[9]also run a lot of UN peacekeeping missions which creates more competition for India.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="9">Contributions made In this chapter，the researchers would research the contributions made by India to the UNSC and the entire World Peace which make a deserving candidate fora permanent seat.The foundations of the United Nations were laid by the brave soldiers on the battlefields of the Second World War.By 1945，they included 2.5 million men of the Indian Army，the largest volunteer force inhistory.Theresearchers would also look at the previous stints of India as a non-permanent member.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="10">India has a unique status ofbeing the founding member ofthe United Nations.It was allowed by the U.K to participate inthe proceedings at San Francisco as it was not independent in 1945.The participation of the Indian delegation in the deliberations was veryenthusiastic and it thus became an active member of the new organisation even when it was still a British Colony.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="11">India has a seminal role in reorienting the UN to make it a developmental body from that of a security organisation.India hasn ’ tbeen a permanent member ofthe Security Council therefore it is due to this reason that its achievement is particularly worthy of credit.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="12">During the early years of 1950 just after India got independence，India became a temporary member of the Security Council.India focused on the General Assembly，trying to identify itself totally and fully with the other newly-independent Asian and African nations.The Security Council of theUnited Nations was divided-from the very beginning because ofthe cold war that was started between the Communist Countries and the WesternCountries.The Western delegation was led by the US and the leader of the Communist Countries was the Soviet Union.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="13">Due to this the other members were compelled to take sides and there were military alliances were being formed as well.India always made sure to stay away fromthis polarising politics of power and therefore activated the General Assembly by the true force of its views and ideas.The concept of peacekeeping came very late，the UNSC permanent members were not in favour of the same.The countries that did not belongto any side provided the troops.The foreign policy of India had difficulties like decolonisation，apartheid，human rights，nuclear disarmament，economic justice relations between south and north，non-alignment，South-South co-operation and democracy.UNSCwas at halt and it was inactive.India also took initiatives and turned everything around in the favour of UNSC and contributed in its active involvement.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="14">The first colony to raise voice against the colonialism and the Europeans was India.It also chose UN as a platform for the same.The UN General Assemblyadopted a resolution on decolonisation in 1950.The ‘ Declaration on the Granting ofIndependence to Colonial Countriesand Peoples ’ was adopted in the session.India campaigned for banningof nuclear testing and eliminating of weapons.China declared itself a nuclear country in 1964.India refused to join.In the year 1963，partial test ban treaty was entered into by the countries.The problem was that the unquestioned dominance and influence was there even after thesame was signed in 1968.This mandated their nuclear weapons.It also made for others to possess the same.The main treatiesregulating nuclear weapons were entered into bilaterally.The United States and the Soviet Union/Russian Federation were party to the same.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="15">India also campaigned against the apartheid.The launch of the movement against apartheid was done even before India became a republic.The UnitedNations adopted a resolution against apartheid only after mid of the fifth decade of the twentieth century.In this context as well，our country has sustained the opposition to apartheid and therefore it led to the imposition of sanctions against South Africa and Southern Zimbabwe.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="16">India took lead in reforming the world order.It has come in handy in the setting up ofUNCTAD in 1964 for promoting trade anddevelopment.In the year 1974 a declaration was adopted for setting up a different world order and also a different economic order.Maintainthe peace ofthe world and managing conflicts has been and probably still is the biggest activity of the United Nations today.India has consistentlybeen a major contributor to the UN peacekeeping forces and the overall initiative.India has contributed with provision of about 240，000 personnel in 49 out of 71 operations taken up by the United Nations so far.As of the moment，the Indian personnelsare actively involved and participating in 9 out of 14 peacekeeping operations.The biggest one is to MONUSCO in DR Congo.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="17">India has always been in favour of imposing sanctions particularly against terrorism.For the very first time when there were sanctions imposed，India leads as the primary force.The western countries very strongly opposed the same but India pursued the same.This was against Southern Rhodesia i.e.，Present day Zimbabwe.UN emphasises on protecting human rights and propagating democracy.India even though supports theseactivities but at the same time opposes any intrusive action to make it come into force.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="18">India has been sincerely and with full force and strength pushing and pressing for the UN to adopt a convention of Terrorism.With this，the aim is to increase international cooperation and make the UN more effective in dealing with the terrorism across borders.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="19">One of the few first countries to have taken an international dispute to UN is India.Pakistan had invaded the princely state of J&amp;K.A resolutionwas adopted on 21st April 1948 which strongly asked Pakistan to withdraw.The plebiscite was also to be held but since Pakistan did not withdraw.Therefore，India made the security council adopt eighteen(18)resolutions in all on the very issue.Lastone being in 1971.Even India continues to allow the presence of UN military observers，the UNMOGIP，in J&amp;K since 1949 but it does not consider the conventions after the Shimla Agreement of 1971 with Pakistan.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="20">Past Missions of India The following have been the missions in which India has contributed since the year 1950.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="21">(a)In the state of Korea from the year 1950 uptill the year of 1954 India provided a Paramedical Unit consisting of 17 officers，Nine JCOs and 300 other ranked army men were deployed for rescuing the sick and the wounded.Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission(NNRC)was set up by the United Nation.India engaged with a force under Maj Gen SPP Thorat comprising 231 officers，over 200 JCOs and thousands of soldiers.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="22">(b)India also provided with an Infantry Battalion and supporting staff for control ofIndo-China comprising of the three states of Vietnam，Cambodia and Laos during the Indo-China from the year 1954 to the year 1970.In this mission as well，970 officers，140 JCOs and over 6000 soldiers were engaged.(c)In the Middle East from 1956 to 1967 the United Nations Emergency Force(UNEF)，for the first-time armed troop contingents were deployed in the middle east.India contributed with an infantry battalion and other elements to support the same.In this mission，yet again，393 officers，409 JCOs and 12383 other ranks were asked to take part over 1 1 years.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="23">(d)In the state of Congo from the year 1960 to the year 1964(ONUC):There were two infantry Brigades comprising of 467 officers，401 JCOs and 1 1354 participating and the operations were held.A flight of six Canberra bomber aircraft of the IAF also participated in operations.A totalof 39 personnel from the Indian contingent sacrificed their lives.Capt.GS Salaria was awarded the Paramvir Chakra posthumously for their role in Katanga，Southern Congo.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="24">(e)In the state of Cambodia from the year 1992 to the year 1993(UNTAC):Indian army set up to supervise and look over the ceasefire，disarm the combatants，take the refugees safely to saferplace and monitor conduct of free and fair elections.Over a thousand armed soldiers were engaged in this mission.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="25">(f)The state of Mozambique from 1992 to 1994(ONUMOZ)saw two Engineer companies，Head Quarter company，logistics company，staff officers and military observers being provided.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="26">All in all，1083 all ranks of officers from the Indian army participated.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="27">Current Missions Even today the army of the Indian nation is currently under taking，out of 16 missions currently being involved into:</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="28">(a)From the month of December of the year 1998，Lebanon(UNIFIL):A group of infantry battalion，a hospital of level 2 consisting of 892 all ranks and 07 staff officers，have been till date been deployed.The situation currently because of the crises in Syria is tense and volatile.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="29">(b)From the April of the year 2005 in Sudan(UNMIS/UNMISS)the Indian nation has contributed with two Infantry Battalion groups，a sector Head Quarter，an engineer company，asignal company，a hospital of Level-II and MILOBS AND SOsin large numbers.Inter-tribe violence occurred due to recent political changes and developments and large scale displacement of locals.The situation currently is highly volatile.Clashed have started to be reported on a regular basis.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="30">(c)From the February of 2006 in Golan Heights(UNDOF)a Logistics battalion consisting of 190 members havebeen put in place to take care of the logistics security of UNDOF.Maj Gen Jai Shanker Menon，Vishishtha Seva Medal is the commander of the Force from March 2016.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="31">The Current crisis there due to the conflict in Syria has heavily impacted the mission.The contingent has its base in Camp Ziounai since the mission got relocated there.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="32">(d)From the February of the year 2017 in the African Nation of the Ivory Coast(UNOCI)the mission is being supported by Indian SOs and MILOBs since the inception.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="33">(e)In Haiti(MINUSTAH)till the Dec.of the year 1997:Apart from three Indian FPUs，namely the Central Reserve Police Force，the Border Security Force and the Assam Rifles the mission was a highly successful one and was ported by the i.e.，from CISF，Assam Rifles and BSF，it has been successful，the mission was successful ported by the staff officers ofthe Indian Army from the beginning.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="34">(f)In Liberia(UNMIL)from the year 2007 a lot of contribution has been done by India interm of both men and women FPUs former CRPF/RAF.The women FPU repatriated in the February of 2016.This also inspires the women of Liberia and sets the trend for other such female FPUs across the Globe.The male FPU repatriated in February of the year 2017.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="35">(g)In UNOCI，UNAMA，UNFICYP，UNTSO，MINURSO and UNISFA，the Indian nation has deployed staff members，troops and other essentials.Reforms needed The decisions made by the UNSC are binding on all the UN member countries.Therefore，it is important that we expand the UNSC beyond the P5 countries so that more and more nations get representation，especially the G4 nations and the UNSC，and the UNSC itself get more credibility.There is a huge difference between the geopolitical situation when the UNSC was formed and the contemporary geopolitical situation.In this chapter，the researchers look forward to elaborating on the above points.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="36">The security council is one of the most important international organizations ofthe world that is largely responsible for peacekeeping operations andmanagement of conflicts of small or large scales.The decisions of the UNSC are binding on all its member nationsand this is where the problem arises.Since the decisions are binding on all the member states，the sovereignty of some of the states may be compromised，for example，imposition of sanctions.Conflict management and maintaining peace is important and necessary，but if it is to be ensured that the member nations respect the decisions ofthe Security Council，for the Security Council to wield credibility and legitimate authority，some much needed reforms must be introduced.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="37">A hard to digest fact is that the prevalent composition of the Security Council is more or less a reflection ofthe geopolitical situation of 1945.Many significant regions of the world including but not limited to Africa，South America and the Caribbean islands do not have representation in the Security Council，compared to what their situation demands.There was some enlargement of the Security council in 1963-65 wherefour additional non permanent seats were created but those changes are not enough.[10]Additionally，the Charter of the United Nations[1 1]also expressly mentions that the countries that contribute significantly to the Security Councilshould be made members of the Council.The G4 bloc contributes significantly towards conflict management and peacekeeping.Yet，the only option that they have is to be a non permanent elected member and too，for just one year.The permanent members of thecouncil should be enlarged enough at least to accommodate the member nations of the G4 bloc.The veto power of the P5 nations is also acause of concern and can be a good starting point for the start ofreforms.Countries like China have consistently stonewalled sustained efforts of some of theG4 countries that present their claim for a permanent membership.The conduct ofthe two European members France and Britain during the Suez Crisis of 1956 isclaimed by experts[12]as an outright abuse of veto power by the P5 nations.In the month ofJuly，1956，the leader of Egypt，President Gamal Abdul-Nasser decided to nationalize the Suez Canal which was owned by the French andthe British，thereby inviting the wrath ofthe European nations and their ally Israel.When Israel invaded Egypt in October 1956，it received the support of Britain and France who actually needed a reason to gain back control over the Suez Canal.Following the invasion of Israel，the United States decided to sponsor a resolution in the Security Council for the purpose of making Israel withdraw its forces.However，not surprisingly，France and Britain used their veto power to stall the efforts.There are dozens of other examples as well which suggest thatthe permanent members have time and again used their veto power for their national interest or to protect the interests of their allies.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="38">There is a growing need for inclusion of more permanent members to the Security Council，especially for the G4 countries.Whenever reforms take place，and circumstances indicate that they should take place as soon as possible，a critical question would be whether the new permanent members would also have the right ofveto.This is a critical issue.However，it would make more sense to not grant the new permanent members the power of veto.All the countries who aspire tobecome a permanent member of the Council have called out the anachronism that the power of veto creates.Hence，it would be more sensible if the new permanent members are not granted the veto.In fact，the G4 proposal of 2005 reflects on the idea of not giving the new permanent members the power ofveto.Instead，a consensus should be achieved after 15 years of granting a permanent membership at a review conference.On the otherhand，the draft resolution sponsored by the African Union countries in 2005 calls for the power of veto to beextended immediately to include new permanent members.Conclusion and future prospect At the end of the research，the researchers aim to arrive at an answer on how much time would it take for India to become apermanent member at the UNSC，what all steps India need to take to build more credibility，and very importantly，the reforms needed by the UNSC.The researchers aim to present an authentic research paper on this subject backed by intensive research，concise data and precise language.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="39">Looking forward，based on the premise of the roadblocks that India faces from the permanent members，its intrinsic problems and the competition that it faces from other G4 nations;the contributions that India has made in terms ofpeacekeeping missions and others;and the reforms that are required at the Security Council to enable inclusion of new permanent members，it can be concluded that it is not about time that India would get a permanent membership at the Security Council.Moreover，chances of a new permanent membership for any country looks bleak，for the foreseeable future.However，the major powers outside the Security Council should push for greater and faster reforms at the Council.At the very least，the prospectus of lengthier terms for the non-permanent members should be pushed aggressively.</p><p class="text-idt25" data-id="40">The G4 members including India should make full use of the non-permanent seat that they get every few years by pushing theiragenda and asking for reforms at the council.The permanent members of the Council should also become more inclusive of the changed geo-political global order from World War II.This alone would create more legitimacy and credibility for the Security Council.</p>        </div>
